# Serverless Services Comparison – Azure vs AWS vs GCP - cst8917assignment2

## Objective
This report compares key Microsoft Azure serverless services studied during the course with equivalent services from Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).  
The comparison includes overviews, triggers/bindings, integration options, monitoring capabilities, pricing models, and an assessment of strengths and weaknesses in a serverless architecture context.


## 1. Azure Functions (Triggers & Bindings)

| Feature | Azure Functions | AWS Lambda | Google Cloud Functions |
|---------|-----------------|------------|------------------------|
| **Overview** | Event-driven, serverless compute platform for running code on demand with built-in triggers and bindings. | Event-driven compute service that runs code without provisioning or managing servers. | Lightweight, event-driven compute service that executes functions in response to events. |
| **Core Features** | Supports multiple languages (C#, Python, Java, JavaScript, PowerShell, etc.), triggers (HTTP, timers, queues), and bindings for storage and messaging services. | Supports multiple languages (Node.js, Python, Java, Go, .NET), triggers (S3 events, API Gateway, CloudWatch), and integrations via event sources. | Supports Node.js, Python, Go, Java, .NET, triggers from HTTP, Cloud Storage, Pub/Sub, Firestore. |
| **Integration Options** | Tight integration with Azure Storage, Event Hubs, Service Bus, Logic Apps, and Azure DevOps CI/CD. | Integrates with over 200 AWS services, CI/CD via CodePipeline, SAM, and CDK. | Integrates with GCP services (Pub/Sub, Firestore, Cloud Build), CI/CD via Cloud Build. |
| **Monitoring & Observability** | Azure Monitor, Application Insights, Log Analytics. | CloudWatch Logs & Metrics, AWS X-Ray. | Cloud Logging, Cloud Monitoring, Error Reporting. |
| **Pricing Model** | Consumption plan: pay-per-execution & execution time; Premium plan for always-ready instances. | Pay per request & compute time (ms) with tiered free limits. | Pay per request & compute time with tiered free limits. |
| **Strengths** | Rich binding support; seamless Azure integration. | Deep AWS ecosystem integration; mature tooling. | Simple setup; integrated with GCP developer tools. |
| **Weaknesses** | Cold starts in consumption plan; Azure-specific bindings. | Limited local development vs Azure Functions. | Fewer native integrations compared to Azure/AWS. |

**Analysis:**  
Azure Functions offers the broadest range of bindings, reducing the need for boilerplate integration code. AWS Lambda is highly mature with a large integration ecosystem, while Google Cloud Functions focuses on simplicity and fast onboarding but has fewer native triggers.

| **Monitoring & Observability** | Application Insights, Azure Monitor. | CloudWatch, X-Ray for tracing. | Cloud Logging, Cloud Trace. |
| **Pricing Model** | Pay for underlying function executions and storage; orchestration billed as function activity. | Pay per state transition + Lambda costs. | Pay per step execution + function costs. |
| **Strengths** | Code-first orchestration; easy state management. | Visual workflow builder; deep AWS service integration. | Simple syntax; tight GCP integration. |
| **Weaknesses** | Azure-specific SDK; less visual than AWS Step Functions. | More complex pricing; no direct code-based orchestration. | Fewer advanced orchestration patterns compared to Durable Functions. |

**Analysis:**  
Durable Functions are excellent for developers who prefer coding workflows directly, while AWS Step Functions shine with a powerful visual designer. GCP Workflows offers simplicity but is less feature-rich for complex orchestration patterns.


## 3. Azure Logic Apps

## Conclusion
All three cloud providers offer strong serverless capabilities, but their strengths vary:  
- **Azure** provides rich integration via bindings and connectors, making it ideal for enterprise workflows.  
- **AWS** leads in ecosystem maturity and service breadth but sometimes requires combining multiple services to match Azure’s single offerings.  
- **GCP** emphasizes simplicity and global scale, making it attractive for quick deployments and data-driven workloads.
